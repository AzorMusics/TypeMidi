# TypeMidi
A Desktop Application to translate Midi Values to RGB Values to a RGB Keyboard for Windows.


## Installation
This Program is a Portable program. You dont need to install itself, but you need the Program called *LoopMidi* to work with *LogiMidi*

You can get LoopMidi here: https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html

## Palettes

Currently the Novation Palette for the RGB Launchpads is used. There will be a Color Palette Editor soon so you can customize it and create your own or load customizations from others.

- Razer
- Logitech

## Will be Supported soon:

- Steelseries
- Corsair

## Q&A

Q: Why did you start making TypeMidi?
A: I started the Project TypeMidi with its predecessor with https://github.com/azormusics/logimidi. this was just a proof of concept that you actually could display Midi Values on a RGB Keyboard. 

Q: Why do i need LoopMidi for it?
A: LoopMidi gives Windows Users the ability to make virtual Midi Devices. In this case we need a virtual Midi Device to communicate between a DAW and TypeMidi.

Q: Can you make it work on a Mac and Linux too?
A: Yes, there will be a Mac version too but the Mac Version doesnt have a UI yet so its a Console Application, but i am not very if there will be something like LoopMidi that can create the virtual Midi Devices to use it properly.
